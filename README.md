fresh_tomatoes
Create a simple webpage about your favorite movies along with their storylines, poster images, and trailers. This project was created as part of the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree.

## Requirements
Developed and tested with Python 2.7.

## Quickstart
``bash
$ git clone https://github.com/gdgon/fresh_tomatoes
$ cd fresh_tomatoes`
$ python2 entertainment_center.py
``

## Adding your own movies
In `entertainment_center.py`, add your movies to the `movies` list. The `media.Movie()` constructor expects the movie's _title_, _storyline_, _poster_ _image_ _url_, and _youtube_ _trailer_ _url_ - in that order. See existing entries for examples.
